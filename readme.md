Map Progress
============

Purpose
-------

I was deeply dissatisfied with all the existing running and walking apps that exist. The purpose of the app is to make the most of the openly available contour data produced by the OS.

Functionality
-------------

Primarily the app will show a chart of the walk against the altitude of the points on the route

### Current featureset

1. Select from all loaded / known routes
2. Display the percentage of completion of the distance and altitude
3. Hide the title
